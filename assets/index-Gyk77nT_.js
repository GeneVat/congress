includes abortions. Such restrictions extend to the use of funds in the budget of the District of Columbia. Additionally,abortions may not be provided in a federal health care facility or by a federal employee.Historically,language has been included in annual appropriations bills for the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) that prohibits the use of federal funds for abortions—such language is commonly referred to as the Hyde Amendment. Similar language is also frequently included in appropriations bills for other federal agencies and the District of Columbia. The bill makes these restrictions permanent and extends the restrictions to all federal funds (rather than specific agencies).The bill's restrictions regarding the use of federal funds do not apply in cases of rape,incest,or where a physical disorder,injury,or illness endangers a woman's life unless an abortion is performed. The Hyde Amendment provides the same exceptions.The bill also prohibits qualified health plans from including coverage for abortions. Currently,qualified health plans may cover abortion,but the portion of the premium attributable to abortion coverage is not eligible for subsidies.",currentStep:"Introduced",tags:["Introduced"]},{bill_id:"S. 198",govtrack_url:"https://www.congress.gov/bill/119th-congress/senate-bill/198",title:"A bill to impose sanctions with respect to the system of compensation of the Palestine Liberation Organization and the Palestinian Authority that supports acts of terrorism.",partySupport:"Republican",summary:"",currentStep:"Introduced",tags:["Introduced"]},{bill_id:"S. 197",govtrack_url:"https://www.congress.gov/bill/119th-congress/senate-bill/197",title:"A bill to require the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States to review any purchase or lease of real estate near a military installation or military airspace in the United States by a foreign person connected to or subsidized by the Russian Federation,the People's Republic of China,the Islamic Republic of Iran,or the Democratic People's Republic of Korea,and for other purposes.",partySupport:"Republican",summary:"",currentStep:"Introduced",tags:["Introduced"]},{bill_id:"S. 196",govtrack_url:"https://www.congress.gov/bill/119th-congress/senate-bill/196",title:"A bill to improve online ticket sales and protect consumers,and for other purposes.",partySupport:"Republican",summary:"",currentStep:"Introduced",tags:["Introduced"]},{bill_id:"S. 195",govtrack_url:"https://www.congress.gov/bill/119th-congress/senate-bill/195",title:"American Music Tourism Act of 2025",partySupport:"Republican",summary:"American Music Tourism Act of 2025 This bill directs the National Travel and Tourism Office (NTTO) of the Department of Commerce to promote tourism to music-related and sports attractions.The bill requires NTTO to promote domestic and international travel and tourism to U.S. music festivals,concert venues,and other music-related attractions and locations.
