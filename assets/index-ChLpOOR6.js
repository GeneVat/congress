Under BBCE,these states typically make households&nbsp;categorically eligible through receiving or being authorized to receive a minimal non-cash TANF benefit or service (e.g.,a pamphlet). A state may set its own BBCE financial eligibility requirements for a household so long as the income requirement is below a certain level.
